# Videogame Development: Ruin Explorer
Repository dedicated to the project releases of the Videogame Development subject from GDDV (CITM, UPC).

In this project we will attempt to put together a vertical platformer called Ruin Explorer, based on difficult platforming and the freedom of advancing taking whichever route the player prefers.
