# Videogame Development: Ruin Explorer
Repository dedicated to the project releases of the Videogame Development subject from GDDV (CITM, UPC).

In this project we will attempt to put together a vertical platformer called Ruin Explorer, based on difficult platforming and the freedom of advancing taking whichever route the player prefers (even though that preferred route may not be the most optimal).


## Controls

* Left Arrow Key: Move Left

* Right Arrow Key: Move Right

* Top Arrow Key: Jump

* Down Arrow Key: Downwards slash.

* Space bar: Boosted jump (when on top of a booster platform). 

* P Key: Pause the Game.

* The player in this game is able to teleport from one side to the other of the screen, though it is not always the best way to advance.

* The bar in the configuration tab is for audio regulation. When clicked on the volume is regulated.
