//->Goal Completed 

Major Needed Implementations and fixes
-Save & Load Feature.
-Fade to Black module proper functioning.
-Audio Module proper functioning.

Quality of life changes and additions
-Adding animations to the teletransportation feature.
-Adding SFX when jump or tp occurs.
-1 Tile platforms are hard to land on, same with landing on the edge of a platform. The player slips downwards. If "Space" is being pressed when landing the player will effectuate a jump in contact with the platform instead of slipping.
-Some 1 tile horizontal spaces are hard to pass through, the player gets stuck between the two colliders. Mantaining "Space" pressed can allow the player to pass through. Top colliders to be made slimmer (implemented but not in enough mesure).

Bugs and coding problems
-After applying scene switch (F2 for volcano map and F5 for temple map) repeatedly, the player spawns one tile higher than he's supposed to.
-After applying scene switch (F2 for volcano map and F5 for temple map) repeatedly, the player sometimes looses its phisics and starts being able to navigate the map freely.
-After dying multiple times the "Left Arrow" imput, which defines movement to the left, becomes activated permanently, even if the player isn't pressing said key (solved by loading any of the two maps again).

Additions to future releases and updates
-Booster addition.
-Enemy addition (together with proper godmode).
-Pickup addition (in order to enforce the usage of the teleport mechanic).
