**Jan Adell** as Programmer, Designer and Media and Asset manager:
 > Working as a support role in the creation of the game, Jan searched and provided the assets for the game. He also designed and created the maps, which were later modified together with Didac as the development progressed. In the programming side, he implemented basic modules, like the one used to include fonts or the Fade module, and added functionalities like Brofiler. He also worked on implementing the audio in the game, fixing memory leaks, or finding error causes while other modules were being worked on by Didac.
